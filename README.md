*I made CDStory as a school project preview for digital literacy, So I made the code open sourced.*

Welcome to CDStory, a fun action pased game that runs right in your Command Prompt!

To Start, download the package by going to the code download. 

Second, Unzip the file and navigate to the file in your command prompt.

Third, When in the correct file, run **python main.py** 

Then you should be good to go!
